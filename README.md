# How to Block YouTube Ads
*Updated Dec 20, 2020*

As of Nov 18 2020, YouTube puts ads on videos without the uploader enabling them. That's not unreasonable since it's a free platform, but it's also fair game for its users to block ads. I've never put any on [my own channel](https://youtube.com/c/emeraldfyr3), and I want to keep it that way as much as possible. Here are the best ways I've found to block YouTube ads on different devices.

## Desktop Browsers

### Firefox
- [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) -- Also a great ad blocker in general

### Google Chrome
- [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm) -- Also a great ad blocker in general

## iOS (Jailbroken)

### YouTube App (Version 15.49.4)
- [YouTopia](https://www.dropbox.com/s/suzrnfhilefp8vc/com.sinfool.youtopia_0.0.2_iphoneos-arm.deb?dl=0) ([Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/jhe0g7)) -- Not hosted on a repo, so install the deb directly with [Filza](https://www.tigisoftware.com/default/?page_id=78).

To install an older version of the YouTube app, use AppStore++ from the repo [https://cokepokes.github.io](https://cokepokes.github.io).
